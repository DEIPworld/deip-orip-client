# Open Research and Innovation Platform

A huge potential of innovation and technology offers the chance to solve big societal problems in healthcare, urban mobility, and other issues. Governments around the world are stepping up their involvement and investments in this sector. Efficient evaluation of IP/intangible assets can be the most dramatic advantage.

Open Research and Innovation Platform is an example of a [Portal](https://app.gitbook.com/o/-MZbOaO8oQgqoGsEN20q/s/-Me9V-Syo9BLuTPeFQ4r/c/-Mk7SB_rKyTkVnUB12jr/learn/portals) built using [DEIP modules](https://github.com/DEIPworld/deip-modules). DEIP Modules supported by the [DEIP Off-chain server](https://github.com/DEIPworld/deip-offchain-server). 
deip-orip-client is a testing environment in which all functionalities and DEIP technologies can be accessed. 

> The DEIP-modules repository consists of Java Script packages designed to build frontend applications and Portals. Modules allow you to connect to services to interact with DEIP infrastructure and are implemented using the Vue framework and Vuetify components library.
